# Installation

There are three options to install the `LuneSDK`. Follow the instructions below for any of the options you prefer:

1. [Swift Package Manager (SPM)](spm.md)
2. [CocoaPod](cocoapods.md)
3. [Manually - using raw XCFramework](manual.md)

---

With that done, you should be able to import the SDK into any of your
Swift files as shown below.

```swift
import LuneSDK
```

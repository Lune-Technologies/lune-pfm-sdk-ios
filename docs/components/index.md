# Components

The Lune SDK components are broadly divided into full-page views and
smaller (mix and match) components.

## Full page views

These components are typically large and were designed to be used as
stand-alone components on a page. While you could still choose to do so,
we strongly discourage adding other widgets as siblings to full page
views.

#### Examples are:

1. [CashflowComponent](full-page/cashflow-component.md)
2. [Expense Component](full-page/expense-component.md)
3. [TransactionListComponent](full-page/transaction-list-component.md)
4. [TransactionDetailComponent](full-page/transaction-detail-component.md)
5. [BrandTrendsComponent](full-page/brand-trends-component.md)
6. [CategoryTrendsComponent](full-page/category-trends-component.md)
7. [CategorySpendListComponent](full-page/category-spend-list-component.md)
8. [BrandListComponent](full-page/brand-list-component.md)
9. [BudgetComponent](full-page/budget-component.md)

## Smaller (mix and match) Components

These components are usually small enough and could easily be arranged
as siblings of other widgets on a page.

Examples are:

1. [CashflowChartComponent](smaller/cashflow-chart-component.md)
2. [CategorySpendChartComponent](smaller/category-spend-chart-component.md)
3. [CategoryTrendChartComponent](smaller/category-trend-chart-component.md)
4. [BrandTrendChartComponent](smaller/brand-trend-chart-component.md)
5. [BudgetFormComponent](smaller/budget-form-component.md)
6. [BudgetSummaryComponent](smaller/budget-summary-component.md)
